# aemodular-cirrus
.wav firmwares for CIRRUS to change the default operating mode

Standard default is Mode 0, the original firmware, which has a bug causing random grain pitch variating.

Mode 1 disables the 1v/oct and pitch cv inputs but fixes the random grain issue

Mode 2 disables 1v/oct but activates pitch input, and is mostly pitch-stable

Mode 3 has some quantization options


cirrus-mode1.wav will make Mode 1 the default setting at power-on

cirrus-mode2.wav will make it default to Mode 2
